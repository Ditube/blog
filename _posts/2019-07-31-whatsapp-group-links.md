You all have heard about and used WhatsApp. It is the best app for chatting or calling. Every friend, family or even office members have their personal groups on Whatsapp so that they can talk, share and stay in touch. But did you know that there are millions of groups on WhatsApp that are created for sharing different types of content like job alerts, memes, jokes, cricket alerts, and so on. Millions of people join such groups every day to get latest updates, make new friends who have similar interests or simply to stay busy with exciting new content through the day.


But finding such groups to join is not easy. You typically have to find such groups by asking your friends or look through scattered online sources. And sometimes, once you find the invite links, the group is either full or inactive or the invite link has stopped working. So I decided to solve this problem by creating a huge public collection of active whatsapp group links, for various topics and languages, that are updated every day. Isn't that great?

Another thing to note is that in order to join groups, users eariler had to ask the admin to add them to the group. This was difficult to do. But now, whatsapp has made it very easy to join all types of groups by launching the "WhatsApp Group Invite Link" feature.

The "WhatsApp Groups - Invite Link" feature is very convenient for all whatsapp users. In order to join any group, you can simply click on the group invite link without needing any permission from any admin. This feature is that simple to use.

So what are you waiting for? Start exploring the unlimited list of **active whatsapp groups**.
