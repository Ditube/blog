Whether you are a student preparing for a job interview or studying for IPS, IAS or UPSC exams in India, or working part-time or full-time in an office job, you need to read and watch news to get ahead in life. Having good general knowledge is essential to do well in interviews, exams or job. Not only that, everyone around, be it friends, family members or acquiantances will start to look up to you and your knowledge. So how can you easily stay up to date with daily news on different topics like Politics, World, Business, International, Cricket, etc? In this article, I will explain how to do this in a very easy and efficient manner.

You all have heard about WhatsApp. It is the best app for chatting or calling for free. Every friend, family or even office members have their personal groups on Whatsapp so that they can talk, share and stay in touch. But did you know that there are millions of groups on WhatsApp that are created for sharing different types of content like job alerts, memes, jokes, cricket alerts, and so on. Millions of people join such groups every day to get latest updates, make new friends who have similar interests or simply to stay busy with exciting new content through the day.

But finding such groups to join is not easy. You typically have to find such groups by asking your friends or look through scattered online sources. And sometimes once you find the invite links, the group is either full or inactive or the invite link has stopped working. So I decided to solve this problem by creating a huge public collection of active whatsapp group links. This article will provide thousands of active WhatsApp Group Links for news and current affairs. Isn't that great?

Another thing to note here is that in order to join groups, users eariler had to ask the admin to add them to the group. This was difficult to do. But now, whatsapp has made it very easy to join all types of groups by launching the "WhatsApp Group Invite Link" feature.

The "WhatsApp Groups - Invite Link" feature is very convenient for all whatsapp users. In order to join any group, you can simply click on the group invite link without needing any permission from any admin. This feature is that simple to use.

So what are you waiting for? Start exploring the following list of **whatsapp group links** for getting daily news and information.
