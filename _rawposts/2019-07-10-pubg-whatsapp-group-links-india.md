Looking to disconnect from the real world and find some entertainment on your favourite messaging platform - WhatsApp?

WhatsApp groups are fun and popular because you get to join the conversations and help shape them by discussing and sharing what you love about a common topic of interest. Using the links mentioned on this platform you can join any group without the permission of the group admin.

Isn’t this an attractive way to make new friends? Since there are no restrictions to the number of whatsApp groups a person can join, you can choose to join any number, as long as you find them relevant to your interests.


## PUBG

Let’s now move along and take a look at all the whatsApp groups that you can easily join for PUBG. Unaware of what PUBG stands for? We’ll help you out.
PUBG is a multiplayer battle game in which players are dropped onto an island, which consists of any of the three maps: Erangel, Miramar and Sanhok, and the player has to attempt to be the last survivor on that island. PUBG allows solo, duo as well as multiplayer gaming wherein a team of up to four players are allowed. Each game has a total of 100 players and takes no longer than 30 minutes on average. There are a number of events/rules which keep occurring during the course of the game to make it interesting. These include things such as the following:
-  dynamic allocation of maps, 
- shrinkage of playable area every few minutes towards a random location, in turn increasing the chance of encounters, 
- need for players to search buildings and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor etc.
- need for combat and situational awareness for quick adaptation to the present state of the game. 
The above-mentioned and many more such events make PUBG a highly engaging game. At the same time, PUBG has created an enormous community of players. This is why so many whatsApp groups created for PUBG lovers and fans. We wanted to help each one of you find them easily so that your network can grow regardless of the level at which you currently play. Even if you are a PUBG beginner, the groups provide you a chance to ask queries regarding the game once you get started and the PUBG pros can help by responding to you quickly.
