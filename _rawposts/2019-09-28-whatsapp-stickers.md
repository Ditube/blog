Now that we've shown you how to send whatsapp stickers to your loved ones, we would now like to talk about how you can create your personal whatsapp sticker, since many of you are interested in creating custom whatsapp stickers to showcase your own creativity and feel proud. 

## Create personal sticker for WhatsApp 
To create personal whatsapp sticker, the following criteria needs to be met with:

<ul><li> Each sticker must be an image with a transparent background </li>
<li> Stickers must comply with 512x512 pixels </li>
<li> Size must be less than 100 KB. In case the size of your sticker exceeds 100 KB, there are ways to reduce the file size. </li> 
<li> An icon needs to be provided to represent the sticker pack in the overall list of packs. The icon needs to be 96x96 pixels and less than 50 KB in size </li></ul>

Now that we're aware of the criteria that needs to be maintained, let's take a look at how one should proceed with creating whatsapp stickers in an Android phone. Following are the steps that must be considered:

<ol>
<li> <strong>Create an image with no background: </strong> 
<ul> 1.1 To do this, first, you should have an image with the desired expressions ready for use.</ul>
<ul> 1.2 Next, you need to download any background eraser app from Google Play Store. </ul>
<ul> 1.3 Now, open the image that you want to convert into a sticker, erase the background and crop the image as per your preference </ul> 
<ul> 1.4 Lastly, save the cropped image in PNG format</ul>
<ul> 1.5 You will need to repeat this step for 3 images, since WhatsApp does not allow to add a sticker pack with less than 3 images. </ul></li>
<li> Next, download another app called <strong>Personal stickers for WhatsApp </strong> from Google Play Store 
<ul> 2.1 When you open the app, it will automatically detect the stickers you have created </ul> 
<ul> 2.2 Tap on the <strong> Add </strong> button displayed beside the stickers and click on Add again if prompted via a pop-up </ul></li>
<li> <strong>You're all done! </strong> Now just open whatsApp and find your personal stickers under the sticker section. Tap on it to send it to your groups or personal chats of your choice.</li> </ol>

In case you don't wish to put in the effort to either create new stickers, or constantly download new sticker apps. There are several whatsapp groups links for stickers and/or other forwards that you can join and start receiving fresh content daily. Here's the list of whatsapp groups that you can choose from
